# Our Methodology

For our development process we use an agile methodology. Our methodology draws from Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), both well-known and well-documented agile methodologies. Therefore, to get details regarding our practices that escape the scope of this handbook, the documentation for these methodologies is the place to look.

So, what does using an agile methodology entail? It means we expect project requirements to be constantly evolving and what we developed a week ago can be very far from what we’re building for tomorrow. You might be wondering: **“What the hell? How are you supposed to plan and build software under those conditions?”**. Well, we do.

Agile methodologies were born out of the inability of other methodologies, like RUP or Waterfall, to adapt to unavoidable changes that occur while a product is being developed. So how do we handle this and keep our clients happy? We follow incremental design guidelines and an iterative development process in order to minimize the risks that this constant evolution entails.

Our estimations are based on a relative scale called story points and not hours, providing less precise yet more accurate results. This means our estimations are less specific and are therefore more likely to be correct since we account for a margin of error in our planning. You might think: “Well, that’s cheating, being less precise is obviously going to give you more accurate results since it’s more likely that your actual time spent will be in that wider range”, but even though we provide a less precise estimation, we make up for it by updating them every week and using the team’s previously recorded work rate as reference.

We organize our development in weekly iterations and each iteration includes 3 activities:

1. **Explore:** The team meets with the client to redact and/or review the following documents associated with the requirements elicitation process.

    1. *User Story Document:* A user story is a representation of a software requirement written as a short phrase in an easy to understand vocabulary. This document contains the user stories that are used to specify the project's requirements and to plan the team's development efforts.
    2. *Architecture Document:* This document contains all the details regarding the technical components that are involved in the project.
    3.  *UI Mockups:* Mockups are simple, wireframe designs of the application's user interface that are used to check that the elicited requirements cover what is expected. Mockups also help the team agree on the scope of the project and easily visualize how the user will interact with the application.

2. **Plan:** After eliciting and validating the project's requirements in the Explore activity, the development team will estimate each user story and plan what will be done for the next couple of weeks. The client's input is critical in this activity since their priorities are taken into account when planning future iterations. After this activity, the team can provide the client with an updated time and cost estimate for what remains to be done.

3. **Develop:** The team develops the application according to the defined plan. This involves constant communication with the client and at least a weekly meeting to share progress and discuss what remains to be done in the current iteration.


## User Stories

**What are User Stories?**

User stories are a short phrase that describes a functionality that a user is expecting the application will . These stories are written from the point of view of the user.
