# The process

At the end of a project cycle or when somebody gets out of the project, we run a *Post-Mortem* or *Lessons learned* process. 

The **Post-mortem** is a valuable tool to ensure continuous improvement for a software development team. Although its name seems forbidding it's just a process to assess how a project went. Some people prefer to call it *Retrospective* instead because *Post-Mortem* seems to be a negative term that implies the death of a project.

In our case, we will stick to *Post-Mortem* or *Lessons learned* since we actually run several retrospectives during the project lifespan and they have different approaches and goals than the ones being described here.

In talPor *Post-Mortems* are carried out in two phases. The first one is individual and consists in filling in a *Post-Mortem report*. Each project member provides his own reflection and assessment about the overall project arc in a way that we can discover what went well and whatf could be done better next time. The ultimate goal is "lessons learned" — a set of actionable ideas for improving the next project.  

The second phase consist in a *Post-Mortem meeting*, this is where the different reports outcomes are discussed and conclusions and "lessons learned" are drawn. 

There are two different scenarios where the *Post-Mortems* are applied:

  1. A team member gets out of the project.
  -  The project cycle ends or the project is finished.
  
For each scenario there is a different course of action. If a **member leaves the team** his post-mortem report will be evaluated in the following *Retrospective meeting*. In this case, the retrospective meeting will consists on the post-mortem evaluation as first task, from which the outcomes will be used as input for the current retrospective where the ex-member is not bounded to participate.

In the case where the **project cycle ends or the project is finished** we organize a *Post-Mortem meeting* as described before.

## Post-mortem report

The purpose of the Project Post-Mortem Report is to record, in detail, the specific project activities that were most effective and those that require adjustments for future projects. The objective of this report is to inform future projsect teams of important lessons learned during the project (i.e. obstacles, challenges, successes, what could be done differently next time, etc.). 

In talPor we have a custom post-mortem report template that is used to gather this information. This template is sent as a google questionnaire and its answers are stored in a google spreadsheet.
