# Source Control

Source control is by far one of the most important tools we use on a daily basis. Learn to use it, love it, embrace it. You'll life will be better for it and so will you work.

As for what software to use, at talPor we use Git. It's awesome.

An important part of using any source control system is having a clear way of using it that the whole team is familiar with. If a team lacks this reference, each team member can do version control their own way and their work will probably suffer.

Our reference for how to use Git is the one described by [Vincent Driessen](http://www.nvie.com) in his blog post [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model).
