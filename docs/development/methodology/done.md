## Definition of done

The Definition of done is a concept extracted from the Agile Scrum
methodology, it's crucial to a highly functioning agile team. It's
defined as a set of criteria or checklist that should be met before a
feature (usually a task or a User Story) is considered **Done**. With
this in mind, everyone that is involved with the team will heave a
common understanding of "what's done". It should be taken into account
that a feature should be considered done when it is a "potentially
shippable" feature or it's ready to be released.

Currently, we use the following criteria to specify if a feature is
done:

  1. The code for the featured was produced.
  -  Tests written and passing.
  - The code is commited and pushed to the development repository.
  - The code is live in the development server.
  - Acceptance tests have been carried out by the client.
  - Code is merged and pushed into Production environment.
  - Code is live into production environment.



> Every task or feature must comply with the definition of done before
> consider it finished!
