## Introduction

When you are working in a software development team, you need a set of
well-defined processes to empower organization, communication and
efficient work. Moreover, inside a company, a standarized set of
processes across every team will allow every project to be treated the
same way, delivering the same quality and facilitating coordination
among teams.

Developers tend to be (re-)assigned to different projects from time to
time. The presence of these well-defined processes will make this
migration smooth as the organizational knowledge of a project should
carry over from project to project (i.e. should be the same for any
other project). This set of processes is what we call the
*methodology*.

This section is intented to give a detailed description of our
methodology, which entails every aspect of the way we work in
talPor. We will describe how we carry out our internals and clients
meetings, how is our setup for our agile development process,
including the tools and processes we use to guarantee the correct
appliance of our methodology, as well as the tools we use to gather
internal feedback about the projects statuses.
