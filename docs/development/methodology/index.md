Methodology
--------------------

### What are you working on?

Use and keep your communication paths up-to-date with your team and
client. Especially, constantly update your Trello lists. Once you start
working on a new card, move it to *Doing*. Once you complete it, move
it to *Done*. As soon as it is available for testing on the staging
server, move it to *In Testing*.

Follow work that is being done by your teammates closely. It is often
useful to read commit messages and check commit changes. Make sure you
are on top of the feedback your client is giving you through all the
channels you have established. If a task is rejected, handle the
feedback promptly. If a new bug is found, handle the feedback or
create a new card and put it on the *Backlog*.

**Keep communication up-to-date.**
