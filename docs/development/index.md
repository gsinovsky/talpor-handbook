Project development phase
---------------------------------

The development phase begins immediately after conception, together
with design it makes up the core of the software development
process. For software engineers, the development phase is their time
to shine. In this stage, user stories are scheduled for development on
a week-by-week basis for the engineering team to work on. Initially,
the focus is on building the functionality of the MVP, while the design
team works in parallel designing the whole user interface and user
experience according to the user stories and mockups. Once the design
team starts producing designs, those are to be implemented into the final
product that will be delivered.


### Onboarding

Right before starting the development process, take the time to establish
clear and redundant communication paths between the client and the team. **It is
preferable to over-communicate than to under-communicate.**

Good communication is the #1 way to avoid overly long meetings and
last minute changes of heart. Involve the client, engage and
listen. Good communication between the team members avoids bugs and
problems down the road. As with the discovery meetings, take time to
schedule *pre-* and *post-meetings* where you review what was done and
what will be done now.

Always keep in mind:

- Use tools to aid your communication. Set up [Slack] for real time
  communication with the client, set up [Trello] to track what is being
  done. Use the integrations between your tools, for example
  Slack-Trello integration can be useful to notify the client new
  changes are up.

- Schedule your client meetings. **Be on time**. If you are being
  dilligent about keeping your communication paths open, meetings
  should be just a summary of what was done and what is going to be
  worked on during the week.

- **Avoid using meetings for testing and bug reports**. Forward
  problems to the right communication channels. This helps keep
  meetings straightforward, and helps you keep track of what needs to
  be done.

### Methodology

For our development process we use an agile methodology. Our methodology draws
from Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), both well-known and well-documented
agile methodologies. Therefore, to get details regarding our practices that
escape the scope of this handbook, the documentation for these methodologies
is the place to look.

So, what does using an agile methodology entail? It means we expect project
requirements to be constantly evolving and what we developed a week ago can be
very far from what we're building for tomorrow. You might be wondering:
**"What the hell? How are you supposed to plan and build software under those
conditions?"**. Well, we do.

Agile methodologies were born out of the inability of other methodologies, like
RUP or Waterfall, to adapt to unavoidable changes that occur while a product
is being developed. So how do we handle this and keep our clients happy? We
follow incremental design guidelines and an iterative development process in
order to minimize the risks that this constant evolution entails.

There are several techniques and weekly tasks that need to be followed as part
of talPor's methodology so read on to the [Methodology](./methodology/index.md)
section for further detail of what needs to be done during a project's life cycle.

### Technical standards

We're a tech company that builds products and in order to deliver a great product
we need to be writing great code and using the best tools and software for the
job. Also, in order to share our experience as a team, we need to be on the same
page as to what software we're using as well as how we're using it. To accomplish
both those things we have a set of standards and recommendations that are documented
in the [Technical Standards](tech/) section.
